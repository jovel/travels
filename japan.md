## Guide to Tokyo

Suggestions based on my Tokyo travels. 

**tl;dr** Wandering around the various Tokyo district with a train card is the best way to enjoy Tokyo. My goal in the following guide to give a couple of waypoints on each district to get your travels started. Hope you enjoy!

### Akihabra

TODO
* Electric town guide
* Ramen

### Asakusa

Asakusa is the home of [Sensoji](https://goo.gl/maps/HNzukuJTArDtzVWn8), the oldest temple in Tokyo. Highly recommend visiting this area and getting your fortune from the fortune sticks
Also, entrance of Sensoji and the surrounding shopping arcades have a lot of food stops - sample of what can be found in the area is [covered by this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oArBcmhqtqY)
Asakusa is also a much older area and has some of the Old Japan feels

TODO: Running station and running along the Sumida River

### Ginza

This is where rich people shop and also the home of all the brand stores. But I do recommend visiting [Mitsukoshi Shopping](https://goo.gl/maps/5w2fc99iXXmCJyXN9)
* Ginza is the fancy shopping district of Japan
* I recommend visiting the bottom floors of Mitsukoshi to check out the most extensive dessert shops available in one area
* This is actually true for all shopping malls, the bottom two floors are a great way to see all the dessert and food locations (it’s an experience that’s better than food courts)

### Harajuku/Omoetesando

I usually tell people to visit [B Side Label](https://goo.gl/maps/5WMPh5btPN1CmHdD7) since it's a good place to find high quality stickers that are great souvenirs that aren't as tacky as your usual souvenirs. It's a good homing location to explore the Harajuku and Omoetesando area without hopefully getting stuck going down Takeshita street - it's where all the teens and tourist hang out. But if you do get stuck in Takeshita Street, the thing to do is to eat crepe - especially from Marion Crepe. There's also a McDonalds nearby and I only mention McDonalds since they have unique dishes that's only in Japan that rotates often.

This area is also where the [Meiji Temple](https://goo.gl/maps/E2tfEugPdy7PwYLP6) is located - highly recommend entering this temple area as it is an experience. Sounds like you're also visiting at a good time to experience the Empress's Garden.

If possible, I recommend visiting this area on Sunday - it's extra busy but you can visit Yoyogi Park which is right next to Meiji Temple and see how Tokyo spends its weekend. There's also a lot of street performances in the park and you may catch the [Rockability group](https://soranews24.com/2014/07/08/a-brief-history-of-japanese-rockabilly-not-just-for-your-grandparents%E3%80%90j-tunes%E3%80%91/) that hangout by the entrance of Yoyogi park

### Ikebukuro

Visit Sunshine City to see the biggest Pokemon Store but warning the other side of the Ikebukuro train station is the red light district so make sure to follow the signs for Sunshine City

### Shinjuku

Shinjuku is both a city and ward - basically to say this area is huge.

I recommend visiting [Ben Fiddich](https://goo.gl/maps/whq99DmrYFbt4YXi7). It's an amazing cocktail bar and the staff and owner (and also the main bartender) all speak English. They're rank as one of the top 25 cocktail bar in the world but what makes Ben Fiddich unique is that the owner also owns a farm where he develops all his liquors and grows his own ingredients. I also recommend getting a shot of the 1916 Spanish Chartreuse

### Shibuya

Also known as the place to go to shop. This is the home of [Hachiko](https://goo.gl/maps/3bcNWAH6G1KMCgoZA), the often used in movies Shibuya Scramble (it's right in front of Hachiko's statue), and the [iconic 109 shopping mall](https://goo.gl/maps/RJ5LUXDh2NicGpDK7). Beware, the Shibuya train station is its own city and it's very easy to get lost inside. Sometimes it's better to just exit and find what you're looking from the outside in. It's the same with the Tokyo Station.

Shibuya gets really busy but unfortunately there's a lot of good food places here: <TODO>


### Shimokitazawa

For music lovers and vintage, used clothing


### Tokyo Station

Another train station that's really easy to get lost in but has a lot of restaurants and best of all dedicated snack stores - Japan cookies and candies are next level.

### Ueno

There's a park here and a shrine in the middle of the lake

Has an Andersen bakery in the train station



### Side Adventures

|What||
|---|---|
|Stamp rally| Every train stop has its own stamp and sometimes its own mascot. You can collect all the stamps of given train line, [e.g. JR Yamanote](https://www.spoon-tamago.com/riding-the-yamanote-line-railway-stamp-rally/) |
|Postal boxes| Most postal boxes in Japan are a standard red box but some [have unique designs](https://matcha-jp.com/en/3683) and you can usually find a guide of where to find them in a post office. Pro tip: there's always an ATM in a post offce |
| Manholes | Each city or area have unique manhole covers. For example, you can track down all the different [pokemon manhole covers](https://voyapon.com/pokefuta-pokemon-manholes-japan/) |
|Disneyland| Tokyo Disney has two parks - Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo Disney Sea. I recommend going to Tokyo Disney Sea and collecting all the popcorn flavors. |
|Tokyo Blackout| Using all your coins for the day (donating to temples does not count) |

### Pro Tips

|Random||
|---|---|
|Train cards| Once you arrive in Japan either get a Suica or Pasmo for faster train travels|
|Getting yen| Japan is still a cash-based society so either recommend buying yen in the US, buying yen in the airport (not the currency exchange one), or withdrawing yen from an ATM. I'd recommend going to a Japanese bank but I think they require you have an account |
|JR Rail Pass| Can only be purchased outside of Japan. May not be worth it unless you know you'll be using the shinkansen a lot. JR trains aren't all shinkansen even though they travel long distance|
|Bakery chain| Lots of bakery chain but Andersen is still super good|
